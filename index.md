## Information

 I love designing and learning about complex systems, especially when I get to tackle more obscure and specific areas such as Inverse Kinematics. I have a lot of variation in my work and pride myself on my multi-faceted skillset, with my ability to quickly adapt and learn new things as the capstone. I have a soft spot for experimental game design and love to work on my own game concepts during my free time.

I studied Game Design and Programming for three years and have recently begun my second period of studies in Artificial Intelligence. I therefore seek areas of work in which I can use my various skills to help out where it's needed to supplement my income, ideally areas of work that allow me to keep learning even more   :)

# Education

Uppsala University - Bachelor's Programme in Game Design and Programming - 3 Years (2022-2025)

# Work

## Converter
Award winning student project in which menial tasks become a venue for storytelling. 

Worked as a consultant and eventually joined as a full team member where I helped with implementing an inverse kinematic system for the toolarms and worked as a programmer / general game developer.

## Slash-Dash-Samurai
Published Rogue-like phone game where you fight various demons as a Samurai who moves according to set paths, taking on various powers to grow stronger in an endless experience.

I worked on this project as the programmer responsible for much of the systems, such as the physics of the players movement, collision and bouncing logic and the level generation. I also handled publishing to the Playstore and gained significant knowledge in the process. Additionaly, I managed our version control workflow and ensured that the many branches of work were properly integrated.

## Octave
Gotland Game Conference Arcade game, where a unique handcrafted input is used to save the forest from the evil elf of the woods through a musical duel (also playable with keyboard).

Worked as product owner, producer and sole programmer on this 6 person rhythm game project.

## VileAintUs
An agressive shoot-'em-up designed for a first year game course, still one of the projects I am most proud of. Taking on the role of an apparent monstrous being you violently attack a facility in this 3D topdown shoot-'em-up, with something deeper dwelling beneath the surface.

Worked on this project as the product owner, producer, 3D artist and programmer. I helped design the main character and I did much of the physics based code.

## Existential Freedom in an Indifferent World
My thesis work, coauthored with a colleague where we examined Dark Souls 1 from a meaning-making perspective, utilizing existentialist philosophy as an anchor for our research. Our focus was on how the game cultivates a unique existential experience we had both encountered personally, even before choosing to examine it more deeply through this auto-hermeneutic study

_I have many skills and personal projects not listed here, such as work on 3D engines from the ground up in OpenGL. If you are curious about any of these don't hesitate to shoot me a message!_
